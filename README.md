# FinToUp

![](https://github.com/Yigrashill/FinToUp/blob/main/src/Images/Logo/FinToupSmall.png)


## Who I m
Hi, I'm Tomasz, and I'm a .NET Developer. However, I feel like I've been stuck in the older .NET Framework stack, so I'm want to learn new things like .NET Core 8.0 and React 18. Additionally, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge in DevOps CI/CD, including Docker, pipelines, and more.

# What is the FinToUp Project?
FinToUp is primarily a financial management project that allows users to manage their monthly income and expenditures on a month-by-month basis.
Secondly, it represents a new journey for me to create something innovative upon completing all other projects. It's an opportunity to work with new technologies and expand my skill set.
Most importantly, the project is for me. While it may become publicly visible, I primarily want a personal tool that I will use daily. This endeavor will also provide an opportunity to learn and grow within new technologies.


# Technology in the Project
## Backend
The backend will be a REST API implemented in .NET Core 8.0 in the CQRS pattern.

## Database
The database will likely be Microsoft SQL Server, employing the Code First approach in the Entity Framework.

## Testing 
I will try to create code by TDD, a approach method.




## DevOPS
Go Try CI action by Actual Sprint-2 branch

## CI proces is building and testing Backend aplication using Pipline

## The frontend
It will be rendered using React 18 with Axios for HTTP requests.
I will explore the possibility of using Flutter for CSS classes and incorporating some pre-built components.
If it will posible in this scope i will try Use Next.js

# Planing 🔁
To have a plan for this application, I've set up a project in Notion and integrated it with GitHub. Whenever I make a pull request to the main or sprint branch with a tag number in the pull request name, I will close the task in Notion. Planning is divided into two-weekly sprints, and depending on my availability to delivercode, I'll aim to complete roughly one task per day to maintain the pace of 100 tasks in :100: days and have steady daily progress. Beffore I start each sprint I will prepare a list tasks in backlog with inteniton to delivering them witch time frame i panned. Of Corse, everything is in Notion :)
The first sprint is described below. 


### Working Hours 🕓
I work on a daily basis :) so I don't have much time to write applications.
However, I've set aside about 30 minutes in the morning before going to work.

# A casual app plan at the Easter table :)

Sprint 1 (March 1 - March 17)

    Creation of the application
    Division of the application into a simple Onion architecture for CQRS
    Creation of simple Commands and Queries
    Integration with Notion
    Creation of simple unit tests
    Establishment and utilization of CI processes

Sprint 2 (March 18 - 31 March)

    Conducted unit and integration tests
    Implementation of the Mediator pattern
    CRUD operations in Rest API
    Unit test of CQRS
    Integration Test of REST API

Sprint 3 (April 1 - April 14)

    Introduction of Entity Framework
    Expanded error handling
    Global error handling
    Usage of middleware
    Added tests in Postman

Sprint 4 (April 15 - April 28)

    Creation of a frontend project in React 18
    Basic TypeScript model
    Developing functions to display objects in a table
    Creation of simple frontend tests

Sprint 5 (April 29 - May 12) - Note, May Holiday
I m in Spain and i lost my mind 😎
    Creation of Axios connections to Rest API
    Discussion on the need to test Axios on the frontend side
    Integration tests
    Building a CI pipeline for building and testing the frontend
    Creation of a CD process enabling deployment of the entire application on Azure

Note: The plan for the first 5 sprints focuses on creating a simple CRUD application and a client to handle this CRUD. After completing these sprints, it will be possible to create the first release of the application. In later stages of the project, it is anticipated that insights will be used to build an appropriate DDD model. The initial phases involve creating a simple CRUD and a "walking skeleton," which does not represent the final structure of the application.

I assume that the application is more for fun than a super solid API that meets strict business standards, but I also want to have something clickable that I made by getting up in the morning before work :)

Sprint 6 (May 13 - May 26)

    Month-dependent model
    Changes in the handling of financial objects
    Use of user context
    Repository modifications

Sprint 7 (May 27 - June 9) - Trip to Spain

    New uses of middleware
    Unit tests
    Changes in the financial controller
    New monthly controller
    Authorization controller
    Integration tests

Sprint 8 (June 10 - June 24) - Work after the contest

    Use of a new REST API on the frontend side
    User authentication and authorization
    A new way of displaying information depending on the user and finances within a month. 

    I lost mind i Spalin 😅
