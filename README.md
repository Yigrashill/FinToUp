# FinToUp

## Who i m
Hi, I'm Tomasz, and I'm a .NET Developer. However, I feel like I've been stuck in the older .NET Framework, so I'm eager to learn new things in .NET Core 8.0 and React 18. Additionally, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge in DevOps, including Docker, pipelines, and more.

# What is the FinToUp Project?
FinToUp is primarily a financial management project that allows users to manage their monthly income and expenditures on a month-by-month basis.
Secondly, it represents a new journey for me to create something innovative upon completing all other projects. It's an opportunity to work with new technologies and expand my skill set.
Most importantly, the project is for me. While it may become publicly visible, I primarily want a personal tool that I will use daily. This endeavor will also provide an opportunity to learn and grow within new technologies.


# Technology in the Project
## Backend
The backend will be a REST API implemented in .NET Core 8.0, utilizing the CQRS pattern.

## Database
The database will likely be Microsoft SQL Server, employing the Code First approach in the Entity Framework pertaining to .NET.
Frontend

## DevOPS
I try to lern more about docker.
And I will be hosting this page on Azure.

## The frontend
It will be rendered using React 18 with Axios for HTTP requests. I will explore the possibility of using Flutter for CSS classes and incorporating some pre-built components.
